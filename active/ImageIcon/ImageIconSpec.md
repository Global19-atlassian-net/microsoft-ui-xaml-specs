# Image Icon

## Background
Today, WinUI has a way to add icons in different image formats from the controls that inherit from IconElement. This includes BitmapIcon, FontIcon, SymbolIcon, PathIcon, and IconSourceElement. If a developer wanted to add an icon that is of type PNG, JPEG, or SVG, WinUI does not have a straight forward way of adding it. The developer could use BitmapIcon but the issue is that BitmapIcon and BitmapIconSource only accept URIs and the regular BitmapImage you would use with an image control only accepts a stream. This will prevent apps from being able to use icons from streams in their menu flyous and other controls that only accept images of type IconElement.

To solve this issue, we will create a control that could replace BitmapIcon in the future and will accept an icon of type ImageSource. This will give the developer the flexibility to add an icon of any image type that ImageSource accepts.  The image types are: 
- PNG
- JPEG
- BMP
- GIF
- TIFF
- SVG

The ShowAsMonochrome property in BitmapIcon will not be part of V1 of ImageIcon as it is not a requirement from design to have all icons be monochrome. Since ShowAsMonochrome will not be part of ImageIcon, the foreground color property inherited from IconElement will not be suported in this control. It will be up to the application to update the icon to match the user's theme. 


## Description
ImageIcon is a UI component that accepts icons of any image type that ImageElement supports today. An ImageIcon will inherit from IconElement so it can be used anywhere an icon control that inherits from IconElement can be used today. ICO image types are not supported by this control. The foreground color property inherited from IconElement is not supported by this control. It will be up to the application to update the icon to match the theme the user has selected. 

**Important APIs:** [ImageIcon class](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.ImageIcon)

## Is this the right control? 
Use an ImageIcon control when you want to display an image as your icon. Do not use an ImageIcon if you want to display an icon from a font. 

## Examples
Below is an example of how you can use ImageIcon in an App Bar Button Item. This example will also be added to the App Bar Button Item page with the rest of the icon controls. 

### Add a PNG icon as an app bar button Icon
XAML
```xml
<AppBarButton Label="ImageIcon" Click="AppBarButton_Click">
    <AppBarButton.Icon>
        <ImageIcon Source="Wheel.png"/>
    </AppBarButton.Icon>
</AppBarButton>
```

# API Notes
### Notable Properties  
| Name	| Type | Description | Default |
|:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|Source | ImageSource | Gets and sets the icon source file that will be used in the application. | Null |


# API Details
```c++
namespace Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls
{
    unsealed runtimeclass ImageIcon : Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.IconElement
    {
        ImageIcon();

        Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.ImageSource Source{ get; set; };

        static Windows.UI.Xaml.DependencyProperty SourceProperty{ get; };
    }
}
```

# Appendix
## Scope
|Capability	| Priority |
|:--- | :--- |
| Icon can be used anywhere a BitmapIcon is accepted today | Must|
| PNG, JPEG, and SVG images are types the control will accept | Must|
| Icon must respond to user theming changes (Light, Dark, and High Contrast) | Could |
| ICO icons will be accepted by the control | Could |
| SVG image support will be improved | Won't |


## Accessibility
Since ImageIcon does not respond to the foreground property inherited from IconElement, it is up to the application to handle the icon color changes when the userâ€™s theme is changed.  

## Open Questions
- Should ICOs be supported in the future? 
- Should he ShowAsMonochrome property be added in the future? This is somehing that was added because of a design requirement back when BitmapIcon was first designed but it is no longer a hard design requirement.
