# Window and Application API updates 

This spec describes updates to the XAML Window and Application APIs to enable them to support Desktop apps in addition to UWP.

# Background

XAML in UWP has a [Window](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Window) 
class which wraps a [CoreWindow](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.CoreWindow), 
and an [Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Application) 
class which wraps a [CoreApplication](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplication). 
For WinUI 3 this is being expanded to not require a CoreWindow or CoreApplication; 
Window can use an HWND, and Application can run a message pump. 
This spec has the API additions to Application and Window to support this.

Note that some existing APIs will also behave differently when running as a Desktop app. 
For example, the static 
[Window.Current](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Window.Current) 
property today returns the Window for the current (calling) thread, 
but in a non-UWP app it will return null. 
Similarly the Window.CoreWindow property will be null when not running as UWP.

> **Spec note**: Some of the APIs here are new, others have new behavior for WinUI3 
when running in a Desktop app.
None of the behavior for UWP apps changes.

# Examples and API Notes

## Window class

Window represents a WinUI application window. It can be used in a 
[UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) 
app or a Desktop app. When run in a UWP app there can only be one instance on a thread.

### Remarks

The Window class can be used both in a UWP app or a Desktop app.

In a Desktop app you can create (`new`) a Window, even if the current thread already has a Window on it.
In a UWP app you must create a new 
[CoreApplicationView](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplicationView),
which will automatically create a new thread and a Window on it. 
See the 'Create new Window in UWP application' example.

> **Implementation note:** Attempting to activate a new window in a UWP app will use use 
[RoOriginateError](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/roerrorapi/nf-roerrorapi-rooriginateerror) 
to show an explanatory message in the debugger.

Creating a new Window in a Desktop app creates a new top level HWND.

### Example: Set the content of a given window and give it keyboard focus.

In a UWP app the read-only 
[Window.Current](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Window.Current) 
property returns the Window for the current thread. 
(A thread has at most one Window and it's created automatically on each UI thread.) 
This property returns null on a non UI thread or in a Desktop app.

The following sets the content of the calling thread's Window in a UWP app and gives it keyboard focus.

```CS
void InitializeAndActivateWindow(Window window)
{
    window.Content = new TextBlock() { Text = "Hello" };
    window.Activate();
}
```

### Example: Create a new window

In a Desktop app you create each Window, and you can create more than one Window on a thread.

```CS
Window window = new Window();
window.Content = new TextBlock() { Text = "Hello" };
window.Activate(); 
```

You can also define a new Window in markup:

```XML
<Window 
    x:Class="MainWindow"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml">
    <TextBlock>Hello</TextBlock>
</Window>
```

with corresponding code-behind:

```CS
public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
  public MainWindow()
  {
	InitializeComponent();
  }
}
```

and then you can create/activate that custom window from code:

```CS
MainWindow window = new MainWindow();
window.Activate();

```

> **Spec note**: no <Window.Content> tag is required because Window.Content is updating to become the
[ContentPropertyAttribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Markup.ContentPropertyAttribute).

In a UWP app any UI thread already has a Window on it, which you can retrieve using the static 
[Window.Current](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Window.Current) 
property. You can create additional windows by creating additional 
[CoreApplicationViews](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplicationView), 
which are always created on a new thread, and which automatically create the following for the new thread: 
[ApplicationView](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationView), 
[CoreWindow](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.CoreWindow), 
and [Window](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Window).

Create a new Window in a UWP app (on a new thread):

```CS
_ = CoreApplication.CreateNewView().DispatcherQueue.TryEnqueue(() =>
{
    // This code runs on the new thread
    Window.Current.Content = new TextBlock() { Text = "Hello" };
    Window.Current.Activate();
});
```

To create a new Window on a new thread in a Desktop app, create the thread first:

```CS
var thread = new Thread(() =>
{
    Window window = new Window();
    window.Content = new TextBlock() { Text = "Hello" };
    window.Activate();
    window.Closed += (_, __) => w.DispatcherQueue.InvokeShutdown();

    var syncContext = new DispatcherQueueSyncronizationContext();
    SynchronizationContext.SetSynchronizationContext(syncContext);

    this.ProcessEvents(); // Message pump
});

thread.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);
thread.Start(); 
```

> **Spec note:** The DispatcherQueueSyncronizationContext is a new API 
[described here](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml-specs/pull/97)

## Window.ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar **[New]**

Gets or sets a value that specifies whether this title bar should replace the default window title bar.

Setting this property to true causes the built-in title bar to be removed. 

(Spec note: this is analogous to 
[AppWindowTitleBar.ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.WindowManagement.AppWindowTitleBar.ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar))

Setting this property only effects rendering, it does not affect pointer (such as mouse) behavior. 
For example, you can still use the mouse to click down in that area and drag the window around 
the desktop. To change that behavior use the `SetTitleBar` API.

Extending the content into the title bar do not impact on the Window buttons 
(Minimize, Maximize, and Close); the buttons will be still there. 

> See the SetTitleBar example below for an example of ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar

(Implementation note: This will be a wrap of the CoreApplicationViewTitleBar.ExtendViewIntoTitleBar
for UWP. In Win32 will remove the Title bar from the Non-Client area when the property is true.)

## Window.SetTitleBar

Makes a XAML element interact with the system as if itâ€™s the title bar.

(Spec note: this is an existing method with new behavior for Desktop)

For example, a user can move the window by dragging the XAML UIElement, 
or a user can invoke the window context menu by right-clicking it. As a consequence the app no longer
receives pointer input when the user interacts with the target UIElement or its children using touch, mouse, or pen. 
The UIElement does still receive keyboard input.

Only one UIElement can act as Title bar, so the last set wins. To use multiple objects, 
you need to wrap them in a container element (for example a Grid).

The rectangular area occupied by the element acts as the title bar for pointer purposes,
even if the element is blocked by another element,
even if the element is transparent.

This method is typically used with the Window's `ExtendContentIntoTitleBar` property 
set to true in order to hide the default system title bar.
However, even when the default system title bar is not hidden, SetTitleBar can be used to make 
additional regions in your app behave like the title bar.

The following shows a Window with a no built-in title bar. 
Instead it uses the whole window as its content area. To enable features such as window dragging, 
it designates a TextBlock as the title bar.

```xml
<Window ...>
    <Grid>
        <!-- ... -->

        <TextBlock x:Name="CustomTitleBar">Custom title text</TextBlock>

        <!-- ... -->
    </Grid>

</Window>
```


```CS
private Window m_window;

protected override void OnLaunched(Microsoft.UI.Xaml.LaunchActivatedEventArgs args)
{
    m_window = new MainWindow();

    m_window.ExtendContentIntoTitleBar = true;
    m_window.SetTitleBar(m_window.CustomTitleBar);

    m_window.Activate();
}
```

## IWindowNative COM Interface **[New]**

This interface is implemented by Window, and in a Desktop app can be used to get 
the Window's underlying HWND.

```CS
protected override void OnLaunched(Microsoft.UI.Xaml.LaunchActivatedEventArgs e)
{
   m_window = new MainWindow();
   m_window.Activate();
   
   // AS is an extension method in the WinRT.CastExtensions class. 
   // The WinRT namespace is needed to use the extension method.
   var windowNative = m_window.As<IWindowNative>();
   IntPtr HWND = windowNative.WindowHandle;
   ...
}

[ComImport]
[InterfaceType(ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIUnknown)]
[Guid("EECDBF0E-BAE9-4CB6-A68E-9598E1CB57BB")]
internal interface IWindowNative
{
   IntPtr WindowHandle { get; }
}
```

## Window.Title property **[NEW]**

Get or set a string to display as the window's title.

This title is displayed in the windows title bar (unless ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar is set),
as well as other locations such as when the user presses Alt-Tab to bring up the application switcher.

### Example

```XML
<Window 
    x:Class="MainWindow"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    Title="Main Window" >
    
</Window>
```

### Remarks

In a UWP app, this property is a wrapper for 
[ApplicationView.Title](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationView.Title), 
which is ignored if 
[CoreApplicationViewTitleBar.ExtendViewIntoTitleBar](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplicationViewTitleBar.ExtendViewIntoTitleBar)
is set to true. 

In a Desktop app this is a wrapper for 
[SetWindowText](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowtexta).

## Window.Current property

Gets the window of the current thread.

### Remarks

The value of this property depends on the thread from which it is called. 
If called from a UI thread of a UWP app, the value is the Window instance for that thread. 
On any other thread, the value is null.

## Window.Closed event

Occurs when the window has closed.


## Window.CoreWindow property: 

Gets the [CoreWindow](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.CoreWindow) associated 
with this Window. In a Desktop app this is always null.

```CS
public CoreWindow CoreWindow { get; }
```

## Window.Dispatcher property
Gets the [CoreDispatcher](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.CoreDispatcher) 
object for the Window when called from a UWP app. Returns null when called from a Desktop app.

```CS
public CoreDispatcher Dispatcher { get; }
```

When running as a Desktop app, this property will be null.

Most members of the Window class can only be accessed when running on the thread the object was
created on. This property, though, can be called from any thread.

## Window.DispatcherQueue property **[NEW]**

Gets the [DispatcherQueue](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.System.DispatcherQueue) 
object for the Window.

```CS
public DispatcherQueue DispatcherQueue { get; }
```

Most members of the Window class can only be accessed when running on the thread the object was
created on. This property, though, can be called from any thread.

## WindowActivatedEventArgs class
Namespace: Microsoft.UI.Xaml

> Issue: should rename these to avoid collision.

> Spec note: this is a new XAML version of the existing Windows.UI.Core.
[WindowActivatedEventArgs](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.WindowActivatedEventArgs).

Contains the windows activation state information returned by the Window.Activated event.

```CS
public class WindowActivatedEventArgs
```

### Properties
- **Handled**: Gets or sets whether the window activation changed event was handled.
 **true** if the event has been handled by the appropriate delegate; **false** if it has not.

    ```CS
    public bool Handled { get; set; }
    ```

- **WindowActivatedEventArgs.WindowActivationState**: Gets the activation state of the window at 
the time the event was raised.

    ```CS
    public CoreWindowActivationState WindowActivationState { get; }
    ```

## VisibilityChangedEventArgs class 
Namespace: Microsoft.UI.Xaml

> Spec note: this is a new Xaml version of the existing 
Windows.UI.Core.[VisibilityChangedEventArgs](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.VisibilityChangedEventArgs).

Contains the arguments returned by the event fired when a Window instance's visibility changes.
```CS
public class VisibilityChangedEventArgs
```

### Properties:
- Handled: Gets or sets whether the window activation changed event was handled. **true** 
if the event has been handled by the appropriate delegate; **false** if it has not.
    ```CS
    public bool Handled { get; set; };
    ```

- Visible: Gets whether the window is visible or not. **true** if the window is visible; otherwise is **false**.
    ```CS
    public bool Visible { get; } 
    ```

## WindowSizeChangedEventArgs class
Namespace: Microsoft.UI.Xaml

> Spec note: this is a new XAML version of the existing 
Windows.UI.Core.[WindowSizeChangedEventArgs](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.WindowSizeChangedEventArgs).

Contains the argument returned by a window size change event.

### Properties

- Handled: Gets or sets whether the  event was handled. **true** if the event has been handled 
by the appropriate delegate; **false** if it has not.
    ```CS
    public bool Handled { get; set; };
    ```

- WindowSizeChangedEventArgs.Size: Gets the new size of the window in units of effective (view) pixels.
    ```CS
    public Size Size { get; } 
    ```

## Application class
Namespace: Microsoft.UI.Xaml

> Application is not new to this spec, what is new are the following remarks

### Remarks

The following events and virtual methods are not invoked when running in a Desktop app:

* void overridable OnActivated(IActivatedEventArgs args)
* void overridable OnBackgroundActivated (BackgroundActivatedEventArgs)
* void overridable OnCachedFileUpdaterActivated (CachedFileUpdaterActivatedEventArgs)
* void overridable OnFileActivated (FileActivatedEventArgs)
* void overridable OnFileOpenPickerActivated (FileOpenPickerActivatedEventArgs)
* void overridable OnFileSavePickerActivated (FileSavePickerActivatedEventArgs)
* void overridable OnSearchActivated (SearchActivatedEventArgs)
* void overridable OnShareTargetActivated (ShareTargetActivatedEventArgs)
* EnteredBackgroundEventHandler EnteredBackground;
* LeavingBackgroundEventHandler LeavingBackground;
* EventHandler&lt;Object&gt; Resuming


## Application.Start method

Provides the entry point and requests initialization of the application. Use the callback 
to instantiate the Application class.

In a Desktop app this will run a message pump internally, and not return until the application 
shuts down. In a UWP app it will return immediately.


## Application.OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs) method

Invoked when the application is launched. Override this method to perform application initialization 
and to display initial content in the associated Window (UWP apps) or create a new Window (Desktop apps).

> This method is typically created automatically when a project is created. 
You can then modify it or remove it.

```CS
protected virtual void OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs args)
```

### Examples

In a Desktop app, use OnLaunched to create the main window and pass it the first command line argument.

```CS
protected override void OnLaunched(MUX.LaunchActivatedEventArgs e)
{
     MainWindow window = new MainWindow();
     
     if(e.Arguments != null)
     {
        string[] arguments = e.Arguments.Split(' ');
	// Assuming MainWindow' has a public property called FileName 
        window.FileName = arguments[0];
     }	

     window.Activate();
}
```

In a UWP app,

```CS
protected override void OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs e)
{
     MainPage page = new MainPage();
     
     if(e.Arguments != null)
     {
        string[] arguments = e.Arguments.Split(' ');
	// Assuming MainWindow' has a public property called FileName 
        page.FileName = arguments[0];
     }	

    Window.Current.Content = page;
    Window.Current.Activate();
    window.Activate();
}
```


## Application.RequiresPointerMode

Gets or sets whether a UWP app supports mouse mode, which emulates pointer interaction experiences 
with non-pointer input devices such as an Xbox gamepad or remote control. (All nested elements inherit 
this behavior.)

> Note: this property is ignored in a Desktop app

## Application.Suspending event

_This is an existing event: 
[Application.Suspending](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Application.Suspending)_

Note that this event is only raised when running in a UWP app, not in a Desktop app.


## Application.OnWindowCreated(WindowCreatedEventArgs) method
Invoked when the application creates a window.

```CS
protected virtual void OnWindowCreated(WindowCreatedEventArgs args)
```

### Parameters
args: Event data for the event. The WindowCreatedEventArgs contains the Window object.

### Remarks
- **UWP**: This method is called once for the creation of the main window, once for each hosted window, 
and once each time CreateNewView is called. 
- **Desktop**: This method is called every time a Window object is created.


## XamlLaunchActivatedEventArgs class

Namespace: Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Application

Provides event information when an app is launched.

> Spec note: this is a new XAML version of the existing Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation.
[LaunchActivatedEventArgs](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation.LaunchActivatedEventArgs).

### Properties

- Arguments: Gets the arguments that are passed to the app during its launch. 
In a UWP app, this is equivalent to LaunchActivatedEventArgs.Arguments.

    ```CS
    public String Arguments { get; };
    ```
- LaunchActivatedEventArgs: Gets the LaunchActivatedEventArgs from UWP. This property is null in a Desktop app.
    ```CS
    public Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation.LaunchActivatedEventArgs UWPLaunchActivatedEventArgs { get; };
    ```

};
```

# Appendix

## Changes in this spec from WinUI Preview2

* Rename LaunchActivatedEventArgs to XamlLaunchActivatedEventArgs
* New Icon property

## Activation state colors

Window title bars should be drawn with different background/foreground colors based on
whether the window is current foreground (active) or background. Additionally, there's an 
option in Windows Settings to use the user's accent color as the foreground of the title bar.
This is not initially be supported.


## Main Window

There is essentially no change here to the "main window" behavior of Window. The
first Window to be created on the Application thread is special, in that closing it
(from code or the user clicking the Close button) will shut down the app. The only
difference is that in a Desktop app, there could be multiple windows on that thread.
