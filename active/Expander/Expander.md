 > This spec corresponds to [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/3279) on the WinUI repo. 

Throughout Windows, different expander controls are used by various apps and surfaces.
Thereâ€™s currently no consistent way to address this common UX pattern.
This control is needed for situations where expanding (instead of overlaying) content is needed.
An Expander control is motivated by its use in many app scenarios and supporting developers in migrating from
[WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/controls/expander-overview?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8)
and [Windows Community Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/communitytoolkit/controls/expander).

## Expander class

Represents the control that displays a header and a collapsible content area.

> Spec note: the Expander class and ExpandDirection enum names match WPF.

An Expander control is a UI component that provides a standard interaction for
showing more content in a container that pushes adjacent content while expanding and collapsing.
An Expander cannot be light dismissed and is independent of the contents inside it, including controls.
Expander should be used when some content is only relevant some of the time (for example to
read more information or access additional options for an item). 

![A collapsed Expander that is expanded (pushing downwards) and then collapsed. The Header has the text "This is in the header" and the Content has the text "This is in the content". There is a TextBlock saying "This TextBlock is Below the Expander" that is pushed away](images/Expander_with_textblock.gif)

### Examples

#### Create an Expander

![A collapsed Expander that is expanded and then collapsed. The Header has the text "This is in the header" and the Content has the text "This is in the content".](images/Expander.gif)

XAML
~~~~
<muxc:Expander x:Name="DefaultExpander" 
    Header="This text is in the header" 
    Content="This is in the content"/>
~~~~

#### Put controls inside an Expander

![A collapsed Expander. The Header has the text "This is in the header" and the Content has a button with the text "This ToggleButton is in the Content". The Expander is expanded, the button is toggled on and off, and the Expander is collapsed. ](images/Expander_togglebutton.gif)

XAML
~~~~
<muxc:Expander x:Name="Expander2" Header="This is in the header"> 
    <ToggleButton>This ToggleButton is in the Content</ToggleButton>
</muxc:Expander>
~~~~

Updated pictures with final visuals to come.

### Theme Resources

You can modify the look of an Expander by specifying Xaml resources in your app.
For more info, see the
[lightweight styling guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/xaml-styles#lightweight-styling).

Some theme resources TBD.

# Inputs and Accessibility

## UI Automation Patterns
Expander will use a ExpandCollapsePattern. Expanding/Collapsing the expander will raise [RaisePropertyChanged](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.automation.peers.automationpeer.raisepropertychangedevent?view=winrt-19041) with the property changed being the [ExpandCollapseProperty](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.automation.expandcollapsepatternidentifiers.expandcollapsestateproperty?view=winrt-19041) property.

## Keyboard
* Tabbing brings focus to the Header, neither the entire Expander nor the chevron is a tab-stop
* When focus is on the Header, space key expands and collapse and focus does not move
* Keyboard navigation inside the Expander's Header/Content is based on the content inside them

## GamePad
The Expander can be expanded and collapsed with A. Spatial navigation will navigate between the content of the Expander. 

## Screen reader
When focus is on the Header of an Expander, the screen reader will announce "Expander collapsed" or "Expander expanded". With focus staying on the header, the screen reader will then anounce "expanded" or "collapsed" accordingly. Expander should not have [focus engagement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/input/gamepad-and-remote-interactions#focus-engagement) enabled.

<!-- Anything else that you want to write down for posterity, but 
that isn't necessary to understand the purpose and usage of the API.

# Open Questions
* How should properties from ContentControl (ex: Background, Foreground, FontSize) propagate?
